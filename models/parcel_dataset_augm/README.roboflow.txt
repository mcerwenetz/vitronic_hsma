Packages - v5 augmented-v1
==============================

This dataset was exported via roboflow.ai on November 13, 2020 at 6:14 PM GMT

It includes 250 images.
Packages are annotated in Tensorflow Object Detection format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 416x416 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 5 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 20 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -5 and +5 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -30 and +30 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 0.5 pixels
