# About This Dataset

The Roboflow `Packages` dataset is a collection of packages located at the doors of various apartments and homes. Packages are flat envelopes, small boxes, and large boxes. Some images contain multiple annotated packages.

## Usage

This dataset may be used as a good starter dataset to track and identify when a package has been delivered to a home. Perhaps you want to know when a package arrives to claim it quickly or prevent package theft.

If you plan to use this dataset and adapt it to your own front door, it is recommended that you capture and add images from the context of your specific camera position. You can easily add images to this dataset via the web UI or via the [Roboflow Upload API](https://docs.roboflow.com/adding-data/upload-api).
